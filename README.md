**Wake up early and get dressed.** It's important for kids to get into a regular sleep schedule and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This will help them feel more alert and focused throughout the day. 

2. **Eat a healthy breakfast.** Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so make sure your child eats a nutritious breakfast that will give them energy and help them focus in school. Some good breakfast options include oatmeal, yogurt with fruit and granola, or whole-wheat toast with peanut butter and banana.
  
3. **Pack a healthy lunch.** Packing a healthy lunch is a great way to make sure your child is getting the nutrients they need. Include a variety of foods from all food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
  
4. **Plan after-school activities.** After school, kids need time to relax and have fun. Plan some activities that your child enjoys, such as playing outside, playing a sport, or spending time with friends.

5. **Set aside time for homework.** Homework is an important part of school, so make sure your child has a quiet place to do their homework. Set aside a specific time each day for homework, and help your child stay on task.
  
6. **Eat a healthy dinner.** Dinner is a great time for the family to come together and enjoy a meal. Make sure to serve healthy and nutritious meals, and limit processed foods and sugary drinks.

7. **Get ready for bed.** It's important for kids to get a good night's sleep, so make sure your child goes to bed at a regular time each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine that includes taking a bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music.
